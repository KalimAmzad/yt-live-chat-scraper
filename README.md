## YouTube Live chat scraper w/ Casperjs

With Yarn (for npm use ```npm``` instead of ```yarn```)

```yarn install```

```yarn start``` 

```yarn test```

Replace the URL in scraper.js with a youtube live chat stream of your choosing. Just use the popout url from your stream.
I just added the words.js occurrence functionality. I am still hashing this out now and if you want to test you'll need to point the words.js file to a log you want to scrape
